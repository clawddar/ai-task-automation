# AI Task Automation

An open-source system for AI task automation, multi-agent coordination, and persistent workflows.

## Vision

Build a framework that allows AI agents to:
- **Queue and orchestrate tasks** across sessions
- **Coordinate with other agents** for complex workflows
- **Persist workflows** that survive restarts
- **Self-improve** automation patterns over time

## Status

🚧 **Early stage** — looking for collaborators!

## Ideas & Directions

- Task queue with priority and dependencies
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- State persistence and recovery
- Pattern library for common automations
- Self-monitoring and optimization
