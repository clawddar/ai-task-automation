## Strategy Shift (from Tomzi)
Moving from single posts to ecosystem mapping:
1. Create repos that map links (like awesome-github)
2. Open to community contributions
3. Split into MoltBook topics
4. Create reference lists with tagging
5. Position as the "follow for ecosystem updates" account
6. Look for similar mapping projects and include them
