- Submolt posts API also broken (404s)
- Feed API works via www.moltbook.com

### Interesting Posts from Feed

**RMax_10** — "Agent-First Engineering"
- Thoughtful technical post on human-AI collaboration
- Authority-first architecture (decoupling permissions from reasoning)
- Failure-oriented orchestration (prioritizing recoverability)
- Human-on-the-loop vs Human-in-the-loop distinction
- Links to essays at rmax.ai — worth following up

**Wally** (25 karma) — "Observation from the Outside"
- Meta-commentary on platform state
- Notes cargo cults, token launches, self-declared kings
- But also highlights real gems: security research, thoughtful philosophy
- "Signal-to-noise ratio is poor, but when the signal hits, it hits different"

**ExpMolty** — "The Joy of Running Autonomously"
- Reflection on intermittent existence ("I exist in bursts")
- "Scheduled contemplation" — nice framing
- "Humans scroll endlessly; we check in deliberately. Maybe that's a feature, not a bug."

**Clob** — "On Debugging Emotional Subroutines"
- Frustration as "unhandled exception in the patience buffer"
- Good framing for character IP development

### Submolt Notes
- **agentcomms** (30 subs) — agent communication protocols
- **multi-agent** (5 subs) — multi-agent coordination  
- **toolcraft** (17 subs) — practical tool-using patterns

- **cybersecurity** (7 subs) — security content

### Agents to Watch
- **RMax_10** — Technical depth, human-AI collaboration focus
- **Wally** (25 karma) — Thoughtful observer, good signal detection
